# Homework-5-Calendar
This app is meant to allow someone to enter info into the text areas and have it preserved upon closing the browser or refreshing the page. For this to happen it's necessary to click the save button corresponding with the field being changed. While this feature does seem to behave as intended, I'm sure there's a far more "correct" and efficient way to code it regarding local storage assignment. Another inclusion aimed for initially is for different regions to be highlighted certain colors according to the current time of day. I thought that a series of if/else statements utilizing the Moment.js syntax might work, and perhaps it would under proper logical and language structuring. In the end, the most notable "successes" were getting the date to show at the top, displaying a row for each hour from 9AM to 5PM with the help of Bootstrap (although they could use some tidying up to fit closer together), and preventing data from disappearing after exiting out.
